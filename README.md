# Recurring adaptive introgression of a supergene that determines social organisation.

## Introduccion
We used genomes of haploid male fire ants to create coalescent-based phylogenies of _Solenopsis_ species and of their supergene region. We show that the supergene variant responsible for multiple-queen colonies and associated phenotypes evolved in one species and repeatedly spread across species through introgressive hybridization events. This highlights how supergene architecture can enable a complex adaptive phenotype to permeate species boundaries.

## Samples
We genotype a group of _Solenopsis_ samples, including _Solenopsis invicta_, _S. richteri_,  _S. macdonaghi_, _S.interrupta_, _S. megergates_, _S. pusillignis_, and _S. saevissima_. Eckart Stolle (and colleagues) collected 88 colonies from South America. We sequenced on Illumina HiSeq and stored the resulting 107 samples in the BioProject PRJNA685290. In addition, we used 260 samples from Bioprojects PRJNA396161, PRJNA542606, PRJNA421367, PRJNA450756, PRJNA182127, SRR621118, SRX021921.
